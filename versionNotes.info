v7.2: Original version of sort codes on alphadon.
      Includes functionality for CsI detectors and PID from PIN diodes
      Timing for HPGe detectors is a work in progress

v7.3 Updated to include Kris' changes to the TIGRESS calibrator to allow 
     selection for timing either from fits or from the DAQ values. The 
     map must be changed to reflect this. A parameter file is included
     in /Analysis/Nov2013/ParFiles called TIGRESS_par_7.3.dat which
     should be used with this code.

v7.7 Alpha particle energy calibration included in calibrator from S1232
     alpha calibration in April 2014.

v7.9 New HPGe/BGO suppression scheme from HPGe/BGO hit map. A new
     parameter file (the TIGRESS_suppression_map.par) must be used in
     conjunction with the new calibrator. The suppression map can be made
     with TigressBGO_TTHP_Map.

v8.0 HPGe/BGO time difference implemented in calibrator for suppression scheme.

v8.2 BGO detector type added. New method for calculating standard deviation for	     suppression maps. TIGRESS and BGO times are independet in calibrator. 
     Program for creating background subtracted spectra added (preliminary
     at this stage).

v8.3 Version used for S1467 in May/June 2015.
