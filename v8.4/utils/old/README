Version notes for waveform analyzer programs
############################################

-----------
Kris_v5.3 and Phil_v7.1 added to have compileable copies of the waveform analyzer in this directory.

The current directory should be linked to the working version of the analyzer. I n the utils directory, there is a link to whatever version of waveform_analyzer.c and waveform_analyzer.h is found there. The entire sort code framework compiles using the waveform analyzer found in Phil_v7.1. 

The working version of the waveform analyzer should be versioned as appropriate.

The goal is to re-write the waveform analyzer and test the performance and failure modes of each component as they are added. The Phil_v7.1 and Kris_v5.3 serve as a template for this process.

There is data in the /TIP/Data/midas and /TIP/Data/sfu directories which can be used to test the performance of the analyzer. I should begin by testing, in order that the

1) baseline
2) temin and temax
3) inclusion zone

are found properly.
